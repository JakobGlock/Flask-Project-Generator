# Flask Project Generator

A basic script to generate a template Flask project, this has been created for my own personal use.

This has been created with the intention of using a database with flask project, so you will need to install some kind of database, I use MYSQL and this project has been created with this intention.

# Setup & Running on Linux

Clone repo onto your machine.

Navigate to the project directory from within a terminal window.

Install into your python path using pip or pip3:

`pip3 install -e .`

You should then be able to call the program using:

`fpgen project-name`

This will run the script and setup the Flask project.

# Tested

I have only tested this on Linux.
