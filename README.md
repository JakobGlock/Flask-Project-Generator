# Flask Project Generator

A basic script to generate a template Flask project, this has been created for my own personal use.

This has been created with the intention of using a database with flask project, so you will need to install some kind of database, I use MYSQL and this project has been created with this intention.

# Running

Make sure the main.py script is executable:

`sudo chmod +x main.py`

Then run the script, remember to provide the project name as an argument:

`./main.py project-name`

# Tested

I have only tested this on Linux, Ubuntu 18 to be more precise.
